                            <H3 style="font-family: Adelia;">Dear Catherine,</H3>
                            <span style="font-family: Freestyle Script">I've been trying to write this letter for 4 months now but as we both know; words tend to fail me when I need them most. 
                            If you're reading this then that means it's either the anniversary of our first kiss and my overcomplicated attempt at a fun website for you has worked, 
                            or the rest of this letter was so incredibly awesome you came back to read it again (Hopefully both have happened).
                            I first thought about writing this right after we spoke about that video, but I was too scared of my own handwriting and what you'd think of it that I never started. So instead, I decided I'd use what I'm actually good at to show you how much I care.(If you squint the scroll lines up and this looks a real love letter trust me)
                            I have one last surprise for you at the end of this letter but for now I hope you don't mind if I talk to you a bit. I warn you in advance, it will get simpy...
                            <br><br>
                            A year ago, we sat down on that little bench in park by the Chatterton Arms and held each other in the cold until eventually, I mustered some courage to show you how I felt about you and asked if I could kiss you.
                            I can confidently say that since that day I don't think I've ever been that scared again.
                            The day you decided to kiss me, my world got a little bit brighter (seriously I could've sworn the sun came back to shine a bit longer),
                            and every kiss since then reminds me of how lucky I am to have you in my life. 
                            You're a beautiful, caring, incredibly smart (nerd) woman and I'm so glad I met you.
                            There's not a morning I wake up without you next to me that I don't feel incomplete.
                            Most days a part of my brain will not stop telling me to simply drop everything and run straight to your embrace for the rest of time itself.
                            Waking up next to you brings me a peace I did not know I deserved to experience. You've taught me to treat myself better than I believed was my right,
                            and with God as my strength, I hope I can make you feel that same way for the rest of your life. 
                            You deserve more than the entire universe; the sun, moon and stars are barely worth a minute of your time. 
                            <br><br>
                            I don't think I will ever truly understand a biology topic, but I could listen to you talk about microbial plaque for hours and never get bored.
                            I love watching you be indecisive, how you zone out when we're watching vampire diaries because you've watched it before, but you want me to finish it (maybe I don't hate it).
                            I love talking your ear off about nerdy stuff that I never admit is nerdy because you're obviously the nerd of this relationship.
                            I love your mouthful grin when you're eating Wingstop, your round glasses above your beautiful black eyes that become golden in the sun.
                            I'm trying so hard not to quote song lyrics right now because I want this to be original but it's too difficult so to borrow from Joey Badass: 
                            <span style="color:#8f0d0d">"I love your curves but what's more preferred is the way you articulate words, I can't help but observe and stare ... you're just so perfect in your own little world, you're everything I want in a girl and it's a matter of time until your last names mine."</span>
                            To quote Christian Kuria: <span style="color:#8f0d0d">"You're my center, you keep me tethered... Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine"</span>
                            And finally, some Bruno Major: <span style="color:#8f0d0d">"There's nothing like doing nothing with you... Have I told you lately I'm grateful you're mine?"</span>
                            <br><br>
                            Okay I'm done quoting but to conclude (English GCSE fr fr) I love you so so so much and I can't wait for our actual one-year anniversary.
                            You are the star of my life and as I'm writing this I cannot wait till the next time I see you. Good luck with your exams and take care of those flowers.
                            I've cherished every kiss I've ever given you and I can't wait for the next one x.
                            <br><br>

                            <H2 style="font-family: Adelia; text-align:right;">To the moon and back,
